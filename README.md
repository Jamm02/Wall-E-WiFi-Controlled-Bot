<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project
* The Aim of the Project is to make a Mouse using the data fusion DMP(Digital Motion Processing) of MPU_6050 and ESP32 with Bluetooth support to actually make it    easier for the user to move pointer in any position they want.
* The Support for Right and Left click is also established using Capacitive touch pins of ESP32.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
Install ESP-IDF : https://github.com/espressif/esp-idf

### Installation
Clone the project
```
https://github.com/gautam-dev-maker/Air-Mouse.git

cd Air-Mouse
```
## Usage

Build
```
idf.py build
```
Flash
```
idf.py -p (PORT) flash monitor

```
### Configuration

```
idf.py menuconfig
```
* `Example Connection Configuration`
  * `Bluetooth Name` - Set Bluetooth Name
  
* `MPU6050 Configuration
  * `SDA Pin No.` - Set SDA Pin No.
  * `CLK Pin No.` - Set CLK Pin No.
* The default Pin configuration used to connect MPU_6050 with ESP32 in this project is shown ![](docs/results/Esp-32andmpu6050_pin_connection.png)  ![](docs/results/Air-Mouse_diagram.png)
  
## Results and Demo
The use of Right and Left Capacitive touch pins has been demonstrated in the following videos

 [Right/left buttons](https://github.com/gautam-dev-maker/Air-Mouse/blob/master/docs/results/Right-Left%20click.mp4)
 
 ## Troubleshooting
 While Configuring for the first time if Bluetooth is not working then ,go to terminal
 
```
idf.py menuconfig
```
Then go to components/bluetooth and enable bluetooth
Press ctrl+s to save the configuration
then
```
idf.py build
```
